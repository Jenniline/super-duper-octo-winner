# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

## Description
The description of this project is a write up to give users of this system an understanding of how the system works and the tools needed inorder to exploit the system fully. In order to do so, the following have to be taken into consideration.
1) ## Requirements 
..*A computer with a webcam or images of a face with closed and open eyes
TODO:


## Comparing Python and Matlab for drowsiness detection
TODO: Do a comparative study of the 2 libraries and propose why we chose python

## Setup
### Requirements:
python >= 3.5

#### Creating a virtual Environment:

1. To create the virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
1. To activate venv `source venv/bin/activate`
1. Install project dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. To run the main file file with video capture: `python src/main.py`

Once done, you can shutdown your virtual environment by:
    `deactivate`
